In this work, a thermodynamically consistent framework has been developed to explore the multi-physics coupling between mechanics and species diffusion. Constitutive laws for the bulk and the across-GB interaction laws have been derived for large deformations from the system free energies. A chemo-mechanically coupled cohesive zone model is developed which takes into account mode-dependent fracture properties in the presence of GBs.

The $\ce{V2O5}$ nanowire demonstrates the impact of chemo-mechanical GB interaction on the final crack pattern.
