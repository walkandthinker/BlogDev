The topic of my thesis is chemo-mechanical modeling of lithium-ion batteries, where the diffusion of lithium as well as the intercalation-induced stress are evolved to study the chemo-mechanical interplay in polycrystalline energy materials.

I developed a thermodynamically consistent framework for both the grains and grain boundaries. Therefore, one can easily get the constitutive laws for the mechanical response as well as the across-GB transport law for both the ion transport and the mechanical failure based on the free energy he inputs.
