My name is Yang Bai, I come from China. I'm a doctoral researcher in the materials science field, my research focuses mainly on the modeling aspect. The finite element method (**FEM**) is one of my favorite weapons to study the physical behavior of materials, i.e., the `phase-separation` in `battery energy materials`, `grain boundary`, `crack propagation`, `large deformation solids`, and so on. It is fascinating to do research and code, but, the family is more interesting than others. Enjoy life!
